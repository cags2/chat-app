About
A chat app dedicated on making a transparency setting. I built it mostly because my friends wanted something different and also mostly see through which might make hiding things less.
Answer these questions: What is your project? Why'd you build it?
Goal and requirements
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AutD8oq3mGf6uybAxIHS1iJPeh_tQRamv11NJyyGYMQ/edit
Make the sign up and login page, make sure the main functions such as taking in profiles and storing it work and also messaging and adding other profiles. Need to design the whole website so that the website looks usable and nice.
Summarize your goals, non-goals, and project requirements from your design doc. Make sure to link your design doc here as well.
Sprint Goal
My sprint goals are to finish implementing a system where users are able to create their own accounts and also able to add each other as friends. I want to try making the chatting thing work but might be a bit hard. Will work on servers that are similar like discord and also direct messages with friends and such.
Key learnings
Css,Javascript, HTML  , Modules/apis, designing and using database
